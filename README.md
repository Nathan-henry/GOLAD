# GOLAD

I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh) didn't upload his awesome version :(

If you want to just play the game, [download the .jar](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/raw/master/GOLAD.jar) and run it.

## How to Play

Red and blue should start with the same number of squares. If they don't, just press new game until they do.

Watch these videos for instructions on how to play:

## Changes from original

- New boards do not generate symmetrically(I should probably add this)

- You can not save up moves. If you decide to create a cell, you simply lose your next turn.
