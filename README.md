# GOLAD

I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh) didn't upload his awesome version :(

If you want to just play the game, [download the .jar](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/raw/master/GOLAD.jar) and run it.

## How to Play

Watch these videos for instructions on how to play:
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RDs2u92MI) - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKQJlvqhDzQ)

## Differences
There are some differences from the rules shown in the videos. 

You may not save up moves, to create a cell, you have to sacrafice two of your own.
