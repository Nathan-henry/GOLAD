# GOLAD

I made this because [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh) didn't upload his awesome version :(

His version is also available on the iOS app store.

If you want to just play the game, you don't need the GOLAD folder, that's just a bunch of messy source code.  

To play the game, download the [.jar](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/blob/master/GOLAD.jar) and the [saves](https://github.com/hanss314/GOLAD/tree/master/saves/tutorial) and run the .jar file.

## How to Play

Watch these videos for instructions on how to play:
[Video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8RDs2u92MI) - [Video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKQJlvqhDzQ)

## Differences
There are some differences from the rules shown in the videos. 

You may not save up moves, to create a cell, you have to sacrafice two of your own.

Also, there are some things included in the iOS version not included in here.

This version does not have online play.
This version does not have AI (yet!)

## Things I should do (feel free to do these things for me)

Implement an AI
